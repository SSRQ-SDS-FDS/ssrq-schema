# Principles of dating

- As much standardisation as possible
- Separate retrieval possible by language (linguistic customs): DE, FR, IT
- Circumcision style (beginning of the year on 1 January), annutiation style (25 March) or Natal style (25 December) must be noted.
- The **sorting logic** of dating or time periods is that everything that could be before a date is also classified before it. For example, 18th century (01.01.1701-31.12.1800) is placed after 1700. If two dates start on the same date but contain different time periods, the more precise date is placed before the less precise one. For example, for the two periods 6th-7th century and 6th-8th century, 6th-7th century comes before 6th-8th century.
